# Fair-Network-Communities-through-Group-Modularity


\section{Introduction}

 Networks are essential for representing and analyzing interconnected systems across different domains, such 
 as in social, collaboration, and citation settings.
Nodes in networks often form communities, i.e., subsets of nodes
that are more tightly connected with each other than with nodes outside the community \cite{jure-book,fortunato2010community}.
Connections in networks play a pivotal role in shaping opinions and influencing decision-making processes \cite{book1, book2}. 
In this paper, we study the
\emph{fairness} of connections within network communities.
